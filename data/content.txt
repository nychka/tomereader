Business Challenge When Telstra, Australia’s leading mobile network operator, wanted to enable a social networking community across its extensive subscriber base, it selected Locatrix to provide an industry-leading solution The Locatrix UandMe™ service, which in the Telstra context is known as WhereisEveryone, lets users with GSM, 3G and HSDPA mobile services keep a real-time and constantly updated snapshot of colleagues’ and buddies’ locations on their cell phones, and set up individual alerts. Once the group - all users have to expressly permit the tracking - has converged, they can use location services to help them ﬁnd a nearby point of interest or meeting place. Locatrix started development on Sun hardware running Solaris, then went the Linux route - ﬁrst with Red Hat Linux and then, after active lobbying from their software architect, to servers running Canonical’s Ubuntu distribution. “We tried Ubuntu as a development platform and it quickly spread through our various projects, (so) we made a decision to host our ﬁrst mobile operator deployment - Telstra - on Ubuntu,” said Locatrix Founder & CEO Mark White. Ubuntu Solution “Hardware detection is Ubuntu ﬁt the job like a glove, he said. For one thing, it allows developers fantastic and the stock to install and lock down the speciﬁc components they want. That has big ramiﬁcations from a footprint and security perspective. Unlike other major kernel has everything Linux distributions, with Ubuntu there was no need to recompile from source we need.

From a security standpoint, the fact that we get to select very speciﬁc package sets to be installed is useful.” The company’s developers also rave about Ubuntu’s AptGet (advanced packaging tool) which automates the retrieval, conﬁguration and installation of applications and eases their management. AptGet is a “huge improvement” over the RTM package manager found in other distributions, White noted. In addition to PHP and Python, Locatrix developers use JavaScript and Java as required. They also work with Visual Studio when they have to program for Windows Mobile devices, but other than that UandMe is a solid LAMP citizen. The Result Telstra, which launched the service via its BigPond Mobile portal in February 2007, is thrilled by the uptake of Whereis Everyone. Indeed, the community of users grows by thousands every week, and the stability of Ubuntu Linux has been a key factor it the service’s success.
